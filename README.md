# Text-Summarization-for-Lecture-Notes
Automatic extractive text summarization of lectures is a powerful tool in education, extrapolating key points without manual intervention or labor. Transcripts from video lectures are available in the context of many MOOCs, but the most valuable information from each lecture can be difficult to locate. The goal of this project is to use transformer-based extractive text summarization models for lecture summarization.
